        <p style="font-size: 20px;font-style: italic;"> This article is about the company.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 35px;font-weight: bold;">From the garage to the Googleplex</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">The Google story begins in 1995 at <span style="font-weight: bold;">Stanford
                University.</span><br>
            <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Larry Page</span> was considering Stanford for grad
            school and <span style="font-weight: bold;font-style: italic;">Sergey Brin</span>, a student
            there, was assigned to show him around.
        </p>
        
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <span style="background-color: yellow;">partnership.</span>
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <span style="color:blue">World Wide Web .</p>
        <p style="font-size: 25px;">They called this search engine <span style="background-color: cyan;font-style: italic;">Backrub.</span></p>

        <p style="font-size: 25px;">Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19th August 2004.<br>
        At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for<span style="text-decoration: line-through;"> 30</span> <u>20</u> years, until the year 2024.</p>
        <p style="font-size: 50px;font-weight: bold;text-align: center;color:green">Thank You!!</p>
