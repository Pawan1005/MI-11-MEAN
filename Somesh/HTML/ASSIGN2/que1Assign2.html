        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p>
            The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong><i>Larry Page</i></strong> was considering Stanford for grad school and 
            <strong><i>Sergey Brin</i></strong>, a student there, was assigned to show him around.
        </p>
        <p>
            By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, 
            but by the following year they struck a <mark>partnership</mark>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine 
            the importance of individual pages on the <strong style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">World Wide Web</strong>.
            <br />
            They called this search engine <mark style="background-color: rgb(255, 56, 105);color:white"> <i>Backrub</i></mark>.
