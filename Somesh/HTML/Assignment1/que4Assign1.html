            <p>
                I am a <b><u>2020 graduate</u></b> from Chandrapur, Maharashtra.
                I've done <i>Bachelors in Science in I.T.</i> specialization. I
                am <b>passionate about learning new things</b>, so in this
                corona pandemic situation i've learned <b>JavaScript</b> with
                <b>LetsUpgrade Community Classes</b>. and I learned
                <b>CSS</b> myself with the help of websites such as
                <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/" target="_blank">
                    w3schools</a
                >
                and after sometime I learned the<b>ReactJS</b> and some other
                techs as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to solve the problems, but sometimes problems are
                irritating. I love to watch hollywood movies. I had started to
                learn to draw recently, it's not my forte but i can draw
                pictures by watching or following the images.
