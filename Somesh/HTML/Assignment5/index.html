                <h2><i>About me</i></h2>
                <p>
                    I am a B.Sc.IT graduate. Still there is much more to learn.
                    A traditional education had given me specialized knowledge
                    but didn't taught me the skills to utilize that knowledge in
                    real life project. My experience with internet taught me
                    that there is a wealth of great information out there but it
                    can be hard to absorb it, convert it into genuine knowledge
                    and understand that how it can be applied in daily life. So
                    here I am looking for a right organization to join to and
                    learn more from them by working with them by giving them my
                    100%.
