            <p style="font-size:20px; text-align: justify;"> The Earth we live in abounds with wonders, mysteries and
                miracles. Out of these, the most spectacular, spontaneous and splendid is what we call “Nature”. Mother
                Nature with unending powers to protect life when it should or uproot life if it must. The given
                paragraphs will give us a better idea of the diverse elements and forms found in nature.Nature includes
                living and non-living components that together make life on Earth possible. Some forms of nature can be
                seen through the lush green forests, the vast sky above us, the oceans without an end, the mountains
                standing tall and so on. Nature nourishes the survival needs of plants, animals and humans alike. It
                provides the essential components of oxygen, sunlight, soil and water. Several other products are
                obtained indirectly from nature which includes timber, paper, medicinal herbs, fibers, cotton, silk and
                various kinds of food. To fulfill the demand for these products, human beings have now engaged in the
                slaughter of trees and the destruction of nature. Different industries also poison nature with harmful
                gases and chemicals in addition to using excessive natural resources. It is the need of the hour now to
                reduce natural damage, reuse goods and recycle used elements to form newer ones. People from all parts
                of the world should come together to lessen the pressure on nature and restore its balance.
                Nature is the endless expanse of life forms, beauty, resources, peace and nourishment. Every bud that
                grows to a flower, every caterpillar that flies with the wings of a butterfly and every infant who faces
                the world as a human, owes its survival and sustenance to nature. In addition to providing resources for
                our daily needs of food, clothing and shelter, nature also contributes to different industries and
                manufacturing units. Paper, furniture, oil, gemstones, petrol, diesel, the fishing industry, electrical
                units, etc. all derive their basic components from nature.
                It can be said that nature drives the process of converting everything that is natural on earth into
                most of the things that are artificial. Nature also maintains the continuity between the different
                spheres on Earth. Owing to the multiple elements obtained from nature, with a growing population, the
                need to meet demands is increasing every day. At an equal pace is rising the level of air, water, soil
                and noise pollution as a result of the universal dependence on technology.
                While it is necessary to keep up with industrialization, it is an urgent need now to restore stability
                in nature. People are trying to curb the level of pollution and stop the exhaustion of natural
                resources. However, more awareness and implementation is a must at the individual and community levels.
                We must always remember it is us who depend on nature for survival and not the other way round.
