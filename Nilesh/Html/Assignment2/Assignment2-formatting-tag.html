            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of individual pages on the <strong style="color:#5052af;"> World Wide Web </strong>. </p>

        <p> They called this search engine <mark style="background-color:#1ad5db;"> <i> Backrub </i> </mark>. </p>
