    <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
    The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University</b>
    <br />
    <b> <i>Larry Page</i> </b>was considering Stanford for grad school and
    <b><i>Sergey Brin,</i></b>
    a student
    <br />
    there, was assigned to show him around.
    <br />

      By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first
      meeting, but by the following year they struck a
      <span style="background-color: #e84545; color: white"> partnership</span>.
      <br />
      Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links
      to determine the importance of individual pages on the
      <span style="color: #892cdc"> World Wide Web </span>.
      <br />
      They called this search engine
      <span style="background-color: #e94560; color: white">Backrub</span>.

      together at Google for <s>30</s> <u>20</u> years, until the year 2024.
