        <h2>From the garage to the Googleplex</h2>
        <p style="font-size: 20px;"> The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University</b>.<br>
        <b><i> Larry Page</i></b> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><i>Sergey Brin</i></b>, a student
            there, was assigned to show him around.</p>
        <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
            year they struck a <span style="background: yellow;">partnership</span><br>
            Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
            individual pages on <b style="font-size: 20px ;color: blue;"> World Wide Web </b>.</p>
        <p>They called this search engine <span style="background:#99ccff;">Backrub</span> .</p>
