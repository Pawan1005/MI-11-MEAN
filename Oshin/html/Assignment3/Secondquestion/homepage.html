        In that life we have been doing recruitment, software development as well as product development.
        Our software business was acquired by a US company called sTec in March 2011.
        Our CEO Anurag Agarwal, was heading India operations for sTec.
        In May, 2013, he decided to move out of sTec and restart the company. 
        And in this life we have taken name AmberSoft.
