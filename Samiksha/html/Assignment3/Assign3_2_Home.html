 Empowerment is the degree of autonomy and self-determination in people and in communities.
 This enables them to represent their interests in a responsible and self-determined way, acting on their own authority. 
 It is the process of becoming stronger and more confident, especially in controlling one's life and claiming one's rights. 
 Empowerment as action refers both to the process of self-empowerment and to professional support of people, which enables 
 them to overcome their sense of powerlessness and lack of influence, and to recognize and use their resources.
 As a term, empowerment originates from American community psychology and is associated[by whom with the social scientist Julian Rappaport.
 However, the roots of empowerment theory extend further into history and are linked to Marxist sociological theory. 
 These sociological ideas have continued to be developed and refined through Neo-Marxist Theory (also known as Critical Theory).
 In social work, empowerment forms a practical approach of resource-oriented intervention. In the field of citizenship education
 and democratic education, empowerment is seen[by whom?] as a tool to increase the responsibility of the citizen.
 Empowerment is a key concept in the discourse on promoting civic engagement. 
 Empowerment as a concept, which is characterized by a move away from a deficit-oriented towards a more strength-oriented perception, 
 can increasingly be found in management concepts, as well as in the areas of continuing education.

        Robert Adams points to the limitations of any single definition of 'empowerment' 
        and the danger that academic or specialist definitions might take away the word and the connected practices from the very people they are supposed to belong to 
        Still, he offers a minimal definition of the term: 'Empowerment: the capacity of individuals, groups and/or communities to take control of their circumstances,
        exercise power and achieve their own goals, and the process by which, individually and collectively, 
        they are able to help themselves and others to maximize the quality of their lives.
