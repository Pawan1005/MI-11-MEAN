        <h1>From the garage to the Googleplex</h1>
        <p>The Google story begins in 1995 at <b>Stanford University.</b><br><b>
        <i>Larry Page</b></i> was considering Stanford for grad school and <b><i>Sergey Brin</b></i>, a student<br>
        there, was assigned to show him around.<br></p>
        <p>By some accounts, they disagreed about nearly everything during that first meeting, but by the following
        year they struck a <span style="background-color: yellow;">partnership</span>.<br>
        Working from their dorm rooms, they built a search engine that used links to determine the importance of
        individual pages on the <b style="color: blue;"> World Wide Web.</b><br></p>
        <p>They called this search engine <span style="background-color: blue;"><i> Backrub.</i></p>

        <p>Google's initial public offering (IPO) took place five years later, on 19th August 2004.<br>
        At that time Larry Page, Sergey Brin, and Eric Schmidt agreed to work together at Google for <del>30</del> <ins>20</ins><br>
        years, until the year 2024.</p>
